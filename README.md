# Cypress Learning Journey 🚀

Welcome to my **Cypress Learning Repository**! This is where I document my progress, projects, and key takeaways as I dive deep into learning Cypress, the powerful end-to-end testing framework.

## 🌟 About Cypress
Cypress is a modern testing framework designed for web applications. It provides a fast, reliable, and easy-to-use environment for writing and running tests.

## 🛠️ Features I’m Exploring
- End-to-end (E2E) testing
- Integration testing
- Writing custom test cases
- Debugging with Cypress
- Automated browser interactions
- API testing using Cypress

## 📘 What I’ve Learned So Far
- Setting up Cypress in a project
- Writing my first test case
- Understanding Cypress commands like `cy.get()`, `cy.visit()`, and `cy.click()`
- Assertions using `should()` and `expect()`
- Handling dynamic elements and waits
- Testing user interactions, forms, and navigation flows
